# Simplified Wumpus.txt Loader

## Overview
I've simplified the custom environment loading to focus only on loading from the `wumpus.txt` file, removing all the complex parsing and validation code.

## What It Does Now

### 1. **Simple File Reading**
- Reads `wumpus.txt` file directly
- Loads character grid exactly as specified
- Places elements directly on the board

### 2. **Direct Board Loading**
- No complex parsing or validation
- Directly sets cell properties based on characters:
  - `W` → Wumpus
  - `G` → Gold (with glitter)
  - `P` → Pit
  - `-` → Empty cell

### 3. **Automatic Perception Generation**
- Generates breezes around pits
- Generates stenches around wumpus
- Maintains game logic

## Files Modified

### `game.py` - Simplified Methods
```python
def load_default_environment(self) -> bool:
    """Load the default environment from wumpus.txt file"""
    return self.load_environment_from_text_file()

def _load_from_text_lines(self, lines: List[str]) -> bool:
    """Load environment directly from text lines"""
    # Simple direct loading without complex parsing
```

## Usage

### Backend
```python
game = WumpusGame()
success = game.load_default_environment()  # Loads wumpus.txt
```

### Frontend
```javascript
gameUI.loadDefaultEnvironment();  // Loads wumpus.txt
```

### Web Interface
- Click "📁 Load from File (wumpus.txt)" button
- Environment loads directly from the file
- No complex configuration needed

## Current wumpus.txt Support

The system now:
- ✅ Reads exactly what's in `wumpus.txt`
- ✅ Places all wumpus, gold, and pits as specified
- ✅ Generates appropriate perceptions
- ✅ Maintains multiple wumpus support
- ✅ Works with existing game logic

## Removed Complexity
- ❌ Complex validation systems
- ❌ Multiple file format support
- ❌ Custom environment creation tools
- ❌ Environment examples and templates
- ❌ Advanced parsing logic
